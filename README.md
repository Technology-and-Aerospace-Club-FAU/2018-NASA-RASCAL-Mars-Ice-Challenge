# 2018-NASA-RASCAL-Mars-Ice-Challenge
This is the main repo for the 2018 Mars Ice Challenge. All the files are going to be in .cpp instead of .ino file that arduino usually uses due to the fact that .ino has limitations that .cpp won't have as we get farther into it. To have the arduino still work, include 
```C
#include <Arduino.h>
```
