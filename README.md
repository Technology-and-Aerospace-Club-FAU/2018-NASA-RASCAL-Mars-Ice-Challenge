# 2018-NASA-RASCAL-Mars-Ice-Challenge
This is the main repo for the 2018 Mars Ice Challenge. All the files are going to be in .ino format (Arduino's main file format, which is a type of C++) and will have custom libraries that will be used. Those will have to be downloaded into the Arduino IDE. To add them into the IDE, you need to go to Sketch -> Include Libraries -> Add ZIP Libraries, and then enter the ZIP file. The links for the custom libraries will be down below.
